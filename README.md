Directions
Now that you have learned about Apache Cordova, it is now time to try working with it yourself. Please zip your project directory and upload when you are finished. This Hands-On will be graded, so be sure you complete all requirements.

In this hands-on exercise, you will build a camera app that can take and display pictures. If you have any questions reach out to your instructor/mentor.

Use the camera and geolocation plugins to implement an app that can do the following operations.

1. Take a picture with the mobile device camera.
2. Display the picture along with the time and date of when the picture was taken as well as the geolocation (latitude and longitude) of where the picture was taken.

To keep the project light, you can make the following simplifying assumptions.

1. You do not need store the picture in any way.
2. You only need to deal with one picture at a time.
